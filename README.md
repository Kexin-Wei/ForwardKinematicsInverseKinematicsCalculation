# Robotics Demo
## Fn 1: Forward Kinematics and Inverse Kinematics (Symbolic) Calculation
using symbolic math package in Python  - SymPy - to calculate forward and inverse kinematics with defined dh tables
- matlab code is also available in the repository, but requires symbolic math toolbox
## Fn 2: draw robot in 3D space (undone)
using matplotlib to draw robot in 3D space, can define color and link size
- compatible with Fn 1. forward kinematics and inverse kinematics

## Eg 1: Kalman Filter in Motion Tracking
with traditional Kalman Filter and Unscented Kalman Filter (filterpy package)

## Eg 2: Unscented Kalman Filter with 1D Pendulum
- sigma points visualization
